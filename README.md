# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Matching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching and navigation problems.  Routes may not match as expected, leading to incorrect component rendering or navigation failures. The issue is often related to route configuration and the order of routes.

## Problem

The initial `App.js` contains a standard React Router v6 setup. However, under certain conditions (for instance, specific URL patterns or nested routes), the routing might not behave predictably, selecting incorrect components or failing to navigate correctly. 

## Solution

`AppSolution.js` provides a solution addressing the potential issues by carefully considering route order and possibly adding more specific or catch-all routes to handle edge cases.  The solution may involve optimizing the structure or adding additional routes for proper control.
